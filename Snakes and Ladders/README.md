Welcome! Here is a Snakes and Ladders project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will build a game of Snakes and Ladders  (aka Chutes and Ladders), which you will be able to play afterwards. You will implement its core functionality, create the game board, and code the game logic. 

Try it out!
